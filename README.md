# AIR_MONITORING_SYSTEM_ARDUINO
This project is a Smoke and Air Detection Alarm System that utilizes an MQ2 gas sensor, a flame sensor , a buzzer for audible alerts, and a 16x2 I2C LCD for visual feedback; when thresholds are exceeded, the system activates alarms, displays warnings, and logs sensor data via the Serial Monitor for debugging and analysis.
# üå¨Ô∏è Air Monitoring System (Arduino)

## Overview
This project implements an air quality monitoring system using Arduino and environmental sensors. It captures real-time data and triggers alerts when air quality falls below safe thresholds. The repository includes source code, documentation, pin mapping, and visual assets for replication and understanding.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino (Air_monreting_system.ino)
- Air quality sensor (e.g., MQ135 or similar)
- Buzzer or alert module
- Excel for pin configuration
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `Air_monreting_system.ino`: Arduino sketch for air quality detection and alert logic
- `Air_Monreting_system Documentation.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `AIR_ALARM_SYSTEM_PIN_OUTS.xlsx`: Pin configuration and hardware mapping
- `circuit_image (5).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Real-time air quality monitoring with embedded sensors
- Threshold-based alert system using buzzer or output module
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- The air sensor detects pollutant levels and sends data to the microcontroller
- If levels exceed a set threshold, an alert is triggered
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and control
