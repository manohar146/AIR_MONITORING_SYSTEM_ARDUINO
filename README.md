# AIR_MONITORING_SYSTEM_ARDUINO
This project is a Smoke and Air Detection Alarm System that utilizes an MQ2 gas sensor, a flame sensor , a buzzer for audible alerts, and a 16x2 I2C LCD for visual feedback; when thresholds are exceeded, the system activates alarms, displays warnings, and logs sensor data via the Serial Monitor for debugging and analysis.
